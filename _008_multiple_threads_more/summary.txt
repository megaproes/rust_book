1. If you feel like you are using .clone() too much, maybe think about using an Rc (reference counter).

2. If you like sketching out a high-level view of your code before you begin, use todo! everywhere, and the compiler will leave you alone.

3. Once you understand its signature, Cow is a pretty convenient type that lets you take in both owned and borrowed values.

4. If you make a new type, you can implement any traits on it you like. This is the most common way to get around the orphan rule. 
But type aliases are just new names for existing types, so using them doesnâ€™t change their underlying behavior.

5. Because threads are independent, another thread might not be finished by the
time main() finishes. If you want to wait for a thread to finish, use the Join-
Handle that you get from the spawn() function.

6. The compiler seems extra strict when using multiple threads because a thread
might live longer than the data it borrows. Usually, you use the move keyword to solve this.
