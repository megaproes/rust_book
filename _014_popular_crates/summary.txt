 External crates are used all the time in Rust, even for key functionality like dealing with time.

2. If you are doing a lot of heavy computing with iterators (and don’t feel like
spawning extra threads yourself), try bringing in the rayon crate.

3. Anyhow is the most frequently used external crate for dealing with multiple
errors, while thiserror can be used to easily create your own error types.

4. The lazy_static and once_cell crates are used for creating global variables
that can’t be constructed at compile time.

5. The functionality of both lazy_static and once_cell are being ported to the
standard library, so eventually you may not need to use any external crates at all
to create any global variables.

6. Blanket implementations let you give trait methods to any types you want.
These are used everywhere in the standard library, too, such as when you get
the .to_string() method for free for anything that implements Display.
