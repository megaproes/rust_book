1. The functions in the std::mem module are really convenient for writing shorter
code and getting around lifetime problems.

2. With a panic hook, you can create your own behavior when a panic happens.

3. You can shrink your binary size a bit by setting the panic behavior to abort
instead of unwinding the stack.

4. A backtrace is now easy to capture at run time without needing an external
crate to do it. You will probably see the backtrace crate in a lot of external
code, though, since the backtrace module is a recent addition to the standard library.

5. The cfg! macro is a quick way to write code that reacts differently depending
on the operating system or any other configuration.

6. The thread_local! macro lets you create static values that donâ€™t get shared between threads.
