// The unreachable! macro is kind of like todo! except itâ€™s for code that will never be
// executed. Maybe you have a match in an enum that you know will never choose one of
// the arms, so the code can never be reached. If thatâ€™s so, you can write unreachable!
// so the compiler knows that it can ignore that part.
