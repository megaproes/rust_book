1. If the compiler can’t find a type for no good reason, check to see whether you need a feature flag to enable it.

2. The most important thing to remember about async is that it doesn’t block
threads. Regular functions block them.

3. An async function just returns a Future, which doesn’t do anything. You have to
.await it to get some actual usable output.

4. There are many ways of working with multiple futures. You can join! them
together, select! to race them against each other and take the first that completes, and so on.

5. Much of this functionality in the async ecosystem is found in external crates.
These often work as staging grounds for testing out new functionality to stabilize and add to the standard library.
