1. Even everyday types like bool and char have new methods added to them all
the time, so keep an eye on the release notes for every new version of Rust to see what has been made available.

2. Be sure to use checked operations if you ever think any of your numeric types
may overflow. They require a bit more typing, but the extra guarantees are worth it.

3. With associated consts, we now know all three associated items. The other two
are associated functions and associated types.

4. Despite the long name, associated items are not that intimidating: associated
functions are just functions, associated types are just types declared inside a
trait, and associated constants are just const values on a type or a trait.

5. Try doing your own tour as well by taking a look at the methods and traits for
the types you use the most in Rust. There is a lot in the standard library that we have only scratched the surface of.
